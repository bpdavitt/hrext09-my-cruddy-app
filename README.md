# hrext09-my-cruddy-app - Workout Tracking
Create Read Update and Delete framework using JS

 ## General Concept

 Allow users to plan and track workouts across a variety of sports. Many fitness tracking apps only track data for COMPLETED workouts, and have minimal functionality for planning future workouts. Other apps that allow for this functionality have a cumbersome interface, require continuing payment, or are really only after your data. There is an unmet need for a no-cost, no frills application to manage the schedule of a complex training regimen.

 ## Tasks
 - [X] Users will be able to enter plans for future workouts
 - [X] Users will be able to update plans for future workouts

 - [X] Users should be able to review planned and/or completed workouts over a given time period ex: MM/DD/YYYY - MM/DD/YYYY
 - [X] Add functionality to view workout composition in chart/graph form (% Swim vs Bike vs Run)
 
 ## Very Advanced Tasks
 - [ ] It would be beneficial to pull completed workout data from fitness tracking devices (ex Garmin watch);
 	- [ ] Parse workouts pulled in from devices, and remove relevent planned workouts if they match

 ### Basic Reqs
- [x] Where to store data? (localstorage)
- [x] How to caputure data? (web form)
- [x] How to modify data? (update action, delete action)
- [X] How to view data? (style?)
- [X] UI/UX considerations (how are we going to use this)
